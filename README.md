## Notes & next steps
- The summary above was created from a single MCP search request (owner: `user:FarhanJamil0001`) that returned 19 repos (includes private repos visible to your token). The `public_repos` field in your profile is 14 — that counts only public repositories.
- If you'd like more detailed metrics I can:
  - fetch per-repo language byte breakdowns and produce an accurate language chart,
  - list open issues and PRs per repo,
  - compute contribution/commit activity for selected repos,
  - export this summary as JSON or CSV and add it to this repository.

If you want any of those, tell me which and I'll add it to the repo (or create an `exports/` folder with the data).
